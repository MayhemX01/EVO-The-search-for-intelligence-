# EVO-The-search-for-intelligence-
Game with inspiration from evo the search for eden

Hello i have been learning python for about a month total time

this is my creation i wanted a game with a look and feel similar to E.V.O the search for eden

I have yet to implement a story yet

the Rough idea is you are a single cell blob who one day decides to swim aginst the current rather then with the current as everything else does

this alows you to gather more food then normal thus you start to evolve into somthing better gaining abilitys as you grow

as of right now there are a few basic upgrades you can get 

swim speed up down

swim speed forward back

these are sprate evos as one is a tall moving you faster forward and back while the other is a fin alowing better reaction time 

both have theres uses thus they are seprate by design

then a health upgrade and a evo bank upgrade

health usfull now

evo bank upgrade not really worth the points in its current state but will be needed for future levels with higher point requirments for evolution

and then you can gain a shooting ability that similar to the electric guys but you have to cath the blue food to recharge its limited shoots otherwise its way to OP

All ideas and helpfull comments are welcomed

i will continue to work on this over time but have no plan or set time to finish it will add to as i learn

im working my way to building a AI assistant for my wife for work as she hates the ones avalible

i grew up on dos 5.0 win 3.1 and have been picking up python pretty quick

this code im positive could be done alot better but i dont know how yet

i may also move it into godot but i kinda wanna do it all in python just becouse i wanna see if it can be done

i plan for 5 total leavels

the next level will be a cave i know that ending will be swallow water with you deleloping the first ever brain 

that will be the end of this game i think we shall see but thats the plan for now

still cant figure out the boss for level one and need to learn how to transition the game to a new level

working on a mario type game to learn levels

all coding for this has been done by me

so i have no clue if it should even work lol but it does

i know alot is dirty but its as clean as i could get it to run so far with very little lag

the lag is comming from the spwan events and the code wating on them i seperated then as much as possible but this game is very cpu bound right now
